## Scenario
Bellabeat is a successful, high-tech manufacturer of health-related devices for women. Cofounders, Urška Sršen and Sando Mur, believe that thorough and detailed analysis of smart device fitness data can help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. 
Bellabeat currently offers 5 products: 
- Bellabeat app: Tracks health data (Ex. Sleep, Stress, Menstrual Cycles)
- Leaf: Wellness tracker that can be worn as a bracelet, necklace, or clip
- Time: Wellness watch that connects to the Bellabeat app
- Spring: Waterbottle that tracks daily water intake with smart technology
- Bellabeat membership: 24/7 access to personalized guidance on wellness

Although Bellabeat is a small company, it has the potential to become a larger competitor in the fitness device market. As a junior data analyst on the marketing analyst team, I have been given the task to analyze smart device data and gain insight into how consumers utilize such products. These answers will help guide Bellabeat's marketing strategy and support the development of new products.

## 2. Prepare
Data Source - Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit
This dataset has 18 CSV. Thirty Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data through a survey from Amazon Mechanical Turk between March 2016 - May 2016. 

This data follows ROCCC:
- Reliability: The data was collected through a reliable source, Amazon Mechanical Turk, who used data from 30   individuals who consented to the utilization of their information.
- Original: This information is from first-party data through data straight from the FitBit users
- Comprehensive: All 18 CSV include information such as minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring
- Current: The data is from 2016, so it is not current and information may be outdated
- Cited: Kaggle page, Zenodo DOI

However, there are many limitations to this dataset
- The data is gathered from volunteers, which can create selection bias in the data rather than gathering information from a random sample
- Data may not be the most accurate due to the lack of updates since 2016
- Only 30 user data, according to the central limit theorem a sample size of more than 30 is preferred for accuracy
- Absence of demographics such as gender, age, or weight
