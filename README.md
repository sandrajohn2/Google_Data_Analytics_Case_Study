## Scenario
Bellabeat is a successful, high-tech manufacturer of health-related devices for women. Cofounders, Urška Sršen and Sando Mur, believe that thorough and detailed analysis of smart device fitness data can help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. 
Bellabeat currently offers 5 products: 
- Bellabeat app: Tracks health data (Ex. Sleep, Stress, Menstrual Cycles)
- Leaf: Wellness tracker that can be worn as a bracelet, necklace, or clip
- Time: Wellness watch that connects to the Bellabeat app
- Spring: Waterbottle that tracks daily water intake with smart technology
- Bellabeat membership: 24/7 access to personalized guidance on wellness

Although Bellabeat is a small company, it has the potential to become a larger competitor in the fitness device market. As a junior data analyst on the marketing analyst team, I have been given the task to analyze smart device data and gain insight into how consumers utilize such products. These answers will help guide Bellabeat's marketing strategy and support the development of new products.
